revphone version 0.01
=====================
revphone is  a reverse phone number lookup to return owner information 

I wrote this module , For a future  project and saw that nobody had written a
module to do this...

It is my first module, so I bet there will be bugs..

if you use it, and like it (or not) please send me an email I would
love to know how many people use this.

usage ......

use revphone;
my $revlookup = revphone;
$revlookup->revlookup('6016841121');

Return-->  Nobody,is_here 555 milky way ln. Clinton, Ms 39056
